# Snake3D
This is an experimental C++ / OpenGL game written with SFML to behave like the classic "Snake" game, however with movement and visuals in 3 axes instead of 2.

Completed objectives:
* Core renderer and camera DONE
* XInput controller support DONE
* Snake object class and attachable controls DONE

To-do:
* Create a pause screen to display when the game is paused
* Code skinning on the "snake" body (vertex buffer loads on each matrix, draw between matrices)
* Add lighting and other enhancements like translucency to snake's path
* Code a collision system or implement a library for collision
* Begin coding a main menu
